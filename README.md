# EHR_physician
This repository houses files for my third year paper: does EHR implementation in hospitals affect physician labor market decisions?

The Scripts folder contains R files in which I clean raw data, construct summary statistics and perform analysis. Each file has a short description commented at the top. All analysis is in "TYP_Analysis.R".
