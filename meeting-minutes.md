# Meeting Minutes 
### This document serves as a log to record what is discussed in meetings with Ian regarding my third year paper.

## 09-30-2021
Questions to ask at the meeting:
- Should I limit the sample to AHA hospitals from the beginning? Capturing only physicians relationships with AHA hospitals?

Major Points Discussed:
- First, we discussed the issues with mergers and how I can potentially deal with them. The issue is: hospitals may adopt EHRs in order to forclose on smaller hospitals, which will affect share of patients at the target firm. For now, I will aggregate the data to the physician level (to avoid spillover effects) and this should mostly take care of the merger issue. There is a quick sensativity check I can do where I drop all physicians that work with a target hospital. In the future, I can bring in merger data and try to trak these things more carefully over time. 
- Next, we discussed some big picture things for this paper. I'm going to back up a little bit and focus more on my original questions, which were at the physician level. I'm going to create dependent variables for working (using variables separate from the shared patients with hospitals: bring in labs and such) and whether physicians are switching to private practices (using SK&A data).
- Also, instead of jumping straight to Sant'Anna and Callaway, start with just basic event study setup. Then work towards more complicated. 

Action Items:
- Bring in shared patient data for total working levels of physicians
- Bring in SK&A data
- Lay out in words exactly what I'm doing in each analysis to make it clear in my own mind

Points of Confusion:
- none
