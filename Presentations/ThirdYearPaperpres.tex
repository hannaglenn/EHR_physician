\section[Motivation]{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{What is an EHR?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Computer-program technology that hospitals purchase
    \item Performance of EHR depends on level purchased:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All include electronic patient records
        \item More complex systems allow for decision making assistance
        \item More recently, patient interfaces are being developed
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{HIT had Great (Expected) Potential in Healthcare}
\begin{alertblock}{Cost Saving}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 2005 estimate finds possible cost reduction of hundreds of billions of dollars (\cite{hillestad2005})
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{Quality Improvement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved efficiency, patient safety improvements, physicians have decision support that could prevent unnecessary complications, etc.
    \item Significant policy push for EHR implementation with these goal in mind: HITECH Act, 2008 provided financial incentive for hospitals to implement EHRs \nocite{hitech}
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\textcolor{blue}{The percentage of hospitals with basic EHR capability rose from 9$\%$ in 2008 to 84$\%$ in 2015.} (\cite{stats})

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What does this mean for physicians?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initially, this means physicians spend more time entering information into a computer and learning a new software
    \item Loss of autonomy as EHRs have progressed
    \item Physicians have experienced significant burn-out from EHRs
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{This Paper}

Does EHR implementation in hospitals affect labor market decisions of physicians, specifically where, and how much they work?

\section{Data}


\begin{frame}{Physician's Incentives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Physician has a choice set of where to work, including multiple hospitals and office-based locations
    \item All physicians I consider work closely with at least one hospital at some point in time
    \item Some proportion of hospitals implement a new technology (an EHR)
    \item How to think about the effect on labor:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item EHR makes seeing patients easier (or more difficult), thus the number of patients seen increases (or decreases)
        \item EHR imposes a burden with a high cost, so the physician switches to working at an office-based location where they have more control
        \item A senior physician could be tipped to retire early instead of taking on the cost of learning a new technology
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Measures of Physician Labor Market Decisions}


     Total Patients: \underline{CMS Shared Patient Data} (2009-2015)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sum of shared patients with all entities that have an NPI
    \end{itemize}
    
     Indicator for whether they are working
    \begin{itemize}
        \item =1 if Total Patients $>0$
    \end{itemize}
    
     Indicator for working in office-based location
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Comes from SK$\&$A database of office-based physicians
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Measures of EHR Use}

Physician-level Indicator that captures exposure to \textit{any} EHR
\begin{itemize}
    \item With information on shared patients between physicians and hospitals, I limit to physicians working in hospitals
    \item Fraction of hospitals worked with that use an EHR comes from the AHA survey
    \item Similarly, I can capture hospitals that use EHRs for decision making vs. documentation using the AHA Survey IT Supplement 
\end{itemize}
