abstract = {We study the effect of hospital adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) on health outcomes, particularly patient safety indicators (PSIs). We find evidence of a positive impact of EMRs on PSIs via decision support rather than care coordination. Consistent with this mechanism, we find an EMR with decision support is more effective at reducing PSIs for less complicated cases, using several different metrics for complication. These findings indicate the negligible impacts for EMRs found by previous studies focusing on the Medicare population and/or mortality do not apply in all settings.},

abstract = {This paper quantifies the effect of state privacy regulation on the diffusion of electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs allow medical providers to store and exchange patient information using computers rather than paper records. Hospitals may be more likely to adopt EMRs if they can reassure patients that their confidentiality is legally protected. Alternatively, privacy protection may inhibit adoption if hospitals cannot benefit from easily exchanging patient information. We find that state privacy regulation restricting hospital release of health information reduces aggregate EMR adoption by hospitals by more than 24\%. We present evidence that suggests that this is due to the suppression of network externalities.},

abstract = {The authors investigate whether electronic medical record (EMR) systems are associated with higher levels of nursing home performance. Their difference-in-differences analysis is based on a survey of health care information technology (HIT) use in approximately 304 New York State nursing homes, combined with regulatory data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Studies (CMS) Nursing Home Compare database and the New York State RHCF-4 financial reports. For nursing home owners, the authors find a positive effect of EMR-system implementation, on the order of 1\% higher productivity, 3\% greater efficiency, but approximately 2.7\% higher cost. They also find that EMR systems amplify the returns to modern workplace organization. Facilities that are one standard deviation higher on a work-organization scale - composed of practices that encourage employee collaboration, decision making, suggestions, and problem solving - have no adverse cost impact of adoption of HIT, and adoption of HIT is associated with a productivity increase of 1.5\% or more. They find no evidence of an impact on health care quality.},
